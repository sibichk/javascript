// obj1 doesn't have a property called 'b', so JavaScript checks 
// its [[prototype]]. Its [[prototype]] is the same as ObjMaker.prototype
// ObjMaker.prototype has a property called 'b' with value 'second'
// returns 'second'

// Because we used 'new', the [[prototype]] property of SubObjMaker.prototype
// is now set to a copy of ObjMaker.prototype

obj2 = new SubObjMaker();
// [[prototype]] property of obj2 is now set to a copy of SubObjMaker.prototype
// Remember that the [[prototype]] property of SubObjMaker.prototype
// is a copy of ObjMaker.prototype with the additional c property defined
// So now obj2 has a prototype chain!
// obj2 ---> SubObjMaker.prototype ---> ObjMaker.prototype

obj2.c;
// returns 'third', from SubObjMaker.prototype

obj2.b;
// returns 'second', from ObjMaker.prototype

obj2.a;
// returns 'first', from SubObjMaker.prototype, because SubObjMaker.prototype 
// was created with the ObjMaker function, which assigned a for us
